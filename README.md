# DataAnalysisECommerce
This project aims to explore an e-commerce dataset containing information about visitors' activities during a seven-day period when an A/B test was conducted. 
Each row of data represents a session, and the outcomes of interest include: add-to-cart, conversion, clicks, and session revenue. The dataset also has information 
about platform (desktop vs mobile), visitor type, product category.
The analysis has 2 main parts:
**1. Analyze whether the A/B test should be rolled out**
**2. Fit a number of machine learning models to understand what factors in the dataset can best predict conversion rate**
